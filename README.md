A crude tool to create the file ScriptSyntax.xml for opensimulator.

Does require dotnet 8.0

It will read the information from the Opensimulator sources.

so you need to provide the path to those sources:

*  GenScriptSyntax  PathToSource

or in linux

*  dotnet GenScriptSyntax.dll PathToSource

example:

  GenScriptSyntax D:\opensimSource
